# Round 1:
Team:
1. Christian Crouthamel
2. Stefan Gergishanov
3. Michael Umbelina 
4. Alexander Whitsell
5. Destiny Nagle
6. Concetta Fischetti

The main way that our team communicated was through discussing 
our tactics or plans that we had. We would lay out our goals at 
the beginning of the round, then as we took our turns we would 
discuss what we would do specifically. We did this to make sure 
everyone was informed of our intentions and ensure that we were 
working towards our goals that we set out. 

# Round 2:
1. The feedback that we tried to address this game was to think 
our turns through better. During the first game, while we tried 
to discuss what we were doing in our turns, we did not always 
think through where we would go from there. In this round, we 
aimed to address this.
2. TO-DO: In class, we talked about two very different sets of communication styles.  Analyze them in the context of this game: which did you see exhibited in your teammates?  Which were valuable and which were hurtful to your progress?  Is one set more useful in a team project than the other or can you leverage both perspectives to improve your communication with your team mates?  Be specific about examples from the game play
3. There is some evidence of Fisher's Model for decision making 
in the choices made by our team. For the first stage, orientation, 
this was already taken care of in the first round in which we got 
to know each other. For this round, we then began the second stage
in which we identified and examined the problem and presented our 
solutions. For the round, we identified that we needed to take 
each objective token and escape with our lives. We then decided 
to take each objective one at a time to ensure that everyone was 
covering each other's back to ensure we survive. For the third and 
final stages, this was done during the game executing our plan and 
confirming with other teammates that our actions would help achieve 
our goals.
